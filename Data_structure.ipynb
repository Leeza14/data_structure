    "## Q1>> Discuss string slicing and provide examples.\n",
    "Ans. String slicing in Python allows us to extract a portion of a string by specifying a start and end index. It follows the format string[start:end], where start is the index where slicing begins (inclusive) and end is the index where it ends (exclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with the string my_string = \"Hello, World!\", if you use my_string[7:12], it will return \"World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If you omit start, it starts from the beginning of the string. If you omit end, it goes to the end of the strig.\n",

    "## Q2>> Explain the key features of lists in Python\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "Python lists are a versatile and widely used data structure that allows you to store and manipulate collections of items. They are ordered, mutable, and can hold items of any data type. Let’s delve into the key properties of Python lists:\n",
    " \n",
    "Ordered\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists maintain the order in which elements are added. The order is preserved even after operations like insertion or deletion. This means that elements can be accessed and referred to by their position  the lists. .\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutble:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning that their elements can be modified after creation. You can change the values of existing elements, add new elements, or remove existing elements. This flexibility makes well suited for dynamic data handling.dling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hetergeneous:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can store items of different data types. You can mix and match integers, strings, floats, booleans, and even other lists within a sin structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can dynamically grow or shrink as needed. You can append new elements to the end of the list or insert them at specific positions. Similarly, you can remove elements   requiremets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements in a list are accessed using their position or index. The index starts from 0, and each element has a unique index corresponding to its posi e end of he list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists support slicing, which allows you to extract sublists based on specified indices. Slicing can be used to create new lists, copylist or perform selective operations on elements.  perations on elemens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists offer a variety of built-in methods for common operations like adding, removing, searching, sorting, and iterating over eleme convinient ways to analyze and m. yze list ata efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be nested within other lists, creating a hierarchical data structure. This nesting allows you to represent complex relationships and organize data in a tree-like fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Python lists are a powerful tool for managing collections of data. Their ordered, mutable, and heterogeneous nature makes them versatile and adaptablePython programming endeavors.\n",

    "Ans>>\n",
    "## Adding elements to the list--\n",
    "There are numerous possible ways in which we can add the elements to this list, Moreover, python has an innate function, we call it append(). Further, while using the append() function, we can only add a single element to this list. Moreover, if we want to add numerous elements to this list then we must have to use the ‘for loop’. However, the append() function adds the element at the end of the list each time we use it and this function takes only a single argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifying the list by adding element to particular position--\n",
    "If we want to add the elements at a particular position then we just have to use the insert() method. insert() takes 2 arguments i.e. position and the value. Moreover, the position refers to the index and here, the elements need to be added. In addition, here the value refers to the element that should be added to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting the elements--\n",
    "We can delete or remove the elements from the list using del and remove() statements too.\n"

    "## Q8>> Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples.\n",
    "Ans. Immutable objects include types like integers, floats, strings, and tuples that contain immutable elements. Once you've defined a key, it remains constant throughout the life of the dictionary. This unchangeability is vital because keys are hashed: they're transformed into integers for rapid access. If you could change a key, it would be like altering a word's spelling after it's been put in a dictionary - chaos would ensue! The mapping would be lost, as the key's hash value would no longer point to the same 'location' in the dictionary.\n",
    "While keys are limited to immutable types, values have no such constraint: they can be integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, or even other dictionaries, which is a concept known as 'nested' dictionaries.\n"
